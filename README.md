# smartdb-project
SmartDB introduces the idea to provide secure access to home. It will be achieved through smart doorbell which is a cost effective alternative to currently its counterparts. Our system connects WiFi enabled android devices with firebase server using Raspberry pi and enables user to answer the door when the doorbell is pressed. It learns to identify new user by using face recognition as a unique identity to authenticate the individual.
